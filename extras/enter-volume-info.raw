Feature: Volume Information

  * Overview of Data Input Process (5/27/2012 Email)
  * Volume
    * Market employees collect volume data on every crop that 
        enters the market as it enters
    * Volume form will be used to enter data for each occurrence 
        (possibly multiple times for each crop each day)
    * For now, we will assume that everything is measured in kilos
        but will adjust later as needed

  As a market clerk
  I want to enter volume summeries for the day by crop and quality

  Scenario Outline:
    Given that I am on home page
    And I can get to the volume entry page

    When I select the "commodity" as "<commodity>"
    And I enter the date <dateValue>
    And I enter the quality "<quality>"
    And I select the "region" as "<region>"
    And I select the "district" as "<district>"
    And I select the "ward" as "<ward>"
    And I enter the amount received <amount>

    And I push "Submit" button
    Then the response should succesfully

  Examples:
#    | commodity | dateValue  | quality | region | district | ward   | amount |
#    | Potatoes(Viazi) | 02/02/2012 | Grade 1 | Mbeya  | Nzega    | Kongwa | 10 |
